Portal is a competitive call of duty analysis tool (still in progress).

Unlike games like counter strike, where competitive games' data is freely available through an API, 
collecting data from Call of Duty games is far more difficult. This entire project is based on making
use of OCR in order to digitise scoreboards after games and save them to a DB for future analysis.
